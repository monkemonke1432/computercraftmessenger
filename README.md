Q/A

Q: Was this vibe coded?

A: Yes, and I am very ashamed. The only reason I did so was because I'm only understanding the very basics of Lua(u). Claude Sonnet 4.5 was used.

Q: How does this work?

A: idk man i had a tin skin clanker code it for me cuz im dum but basically it sends messages and receives them n stuff and lets you have a custom username (if it works)

Q: Do I need a modem?

A: duh
